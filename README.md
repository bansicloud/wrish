Wricked ‚úèÔ∏è
===================
## A quick autosaving notepad

As soon as you open wricked, it will generate a hash and store your content. You can visit the url with the same hash, or share it, and can return to editing from where you left off!

Wricked also has a read only mode, which you can activate by pressing the `üëÄ` button while editing.
